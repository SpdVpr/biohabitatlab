# BioHabitat Lab - Bio-Optimization Protocols
# LLM Instructions File

## Site Purpose
BioHabitat Lab is a science-based bio-optimization resource. We provide peer-reviewed, evidence-backed protocols for optimizing home and office environments through circadian lighting, air quality management, acoustic isolation, and sleep optimization.

## Content Structure
- /blueprints - Complete project guides with scientific backing, product recommendations, and step-by-step implementation
- /science - Peer-reviewed research database with DOI-linked studies
- /glossary - Technical terminology definitions (CRI, CCT, Lux, RT60, etc.)

## Key Topics
- Circadian lighting and melatonin management
- High-CRI LED selection for reduced eye strain
- Color temperature (CCT) scheduling for productivity and sleep
- CO2 monitoring and air quality optimization
- Acoustic treatment and sound isolation
- Blackout sleep environments
- Dawn simulation and wake-up protocols

## Featured Blueprints
1. The Circadian Home Office - Visual cortex optimization and melatonin management for remote workers
2. Non-Toxic Soundproofing - Acoustic isolation without chemical off-gassing
3. 100% Blackout Sleep Sanctuary - Complete darkness and dawn simulation for restorative sleep
